For the most part, you can use:
TEST_FUNCTION(name)

and,

INCLUDE_TEST__STATELESS(name)

for most tests. See test_util.h in core/include
for usable macros. In each test module, you will
find a DEFINE_SUITE([module name], END_TESTS)
You will add tests like so:

DEFINE_SUITE([module name],
    INCLUDE_TEST__STATELESS(name),
    END_TESTS)

Tests should return the following:
    MUNIT_OK
    MUNIT_FAIL

For the various assertions, check:
    munit.h

Credit to mikelong on StackOverflow for the idea
of including the C source file into the test module.
